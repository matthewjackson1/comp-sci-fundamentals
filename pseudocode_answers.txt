##### Short Answer #####

>> Why do programmers use pseudocode?

- To plan out an algorithm without using any specific language's syntax.


>> If you tried to run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

- You can't run pseudocode on your computer, it is not a real programming language.


###### Programming Assignment ######

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

>> Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the second number is greater than the first number THEN
	PRINT the second number
ELSE
	PRINT the first number
ENDIF

>> Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FOR i = 0 TO i = 99 WITH i++ after each iteration
	PRINT i+1
END FOR


>> Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION phonebookSearch(name, phonebook)
	IF an entry exists in the phonebook object with a name matching 
		Return the entry
	ELSE
		Return "Entry not found"
END FUNCTION


>> With the pseudocode, you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any language of your choice.

- The below is assuming phonebook is an object which uses names as keys and a user is searching for a specific name

{"Matthew Jackson":"077291937908", "Amanda Friedman":"07992089090" .... etc.}

const phonebookSearch = (name, phonebook) => {
	if (phonebook[name]) {
		return phonebook[name];
	}
	else {
		return "Entry not found";
	};
};
